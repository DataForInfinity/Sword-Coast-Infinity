-=Dualadins=-

When looking at the state of Paladins something always throw me off. An extremely front-loaded class unable to dual-class, they are lacking much of the excitement others could provide in the long run. With the unmentioned boon to wield unique OP weapons becoming their only saving grace in my eyes. The base class lost its purpose with the introduction of kits. The BG2 Cavalier is an odd home brew based on a PnP Fighter kit (which in all fairness is claimed to be suitable for Paladins). The Inquisitor either too strong or boring, depending on how well you could dispel with other classes. And the Undead Hunter often considered more as an oversight.

Disclaimer: Infamously, Paladins are not able to dual class by any means without crashing the game due to hard coded engine limitations. We will do it anyway. But expect some minor cosmetic inconvenience, because we are abusing the Cleric/Ranger class Designation.



[100] Base-class Paladin can dual-class to Cleric

With the advent of kits the standard Paladin was basically pushed into oblivion. This component will grant only the base class Paladin the ability to dual-class in the only sensible way, to a Cleric. Because Paladins cannot use the standard interface for this, I give them an innate ability 'Secret Vow' on second level which will shift their class into a pseudo Paladin kit under the Ranger class. This enables use of the interface and preserves all squired abilities. As a little extra the Paladin/Cleric will be continue to have access to any Paladin exclusive spells.

Congrats, you now have a Paladin which can turn into a Cleric! At the small cost of showing as Cleric/Ranger class combo. Because Clerics can't use swords you wouldn't even notice that you just lost the ability to wield your holy avengerâ€¦ read on to fix this.
