They said it was impossible. And technically they were right: there can be no true Paladin dual-class without braking your save game. But implementing the Paladin as a Ranger kit allows to dual-class perfectly normal! You create your Paladin character as usual and at level 2 can use anew ability to speak to your god and vow to become a cleric. If that bothers you, just tell him to stay away and your Paladin will be as if this mod was never installed. Oh, and if you did not intend to play a Paladin [charname], have I mentioned that Keldorn can make all other Clerics pale with awe?

It is save to install it all - except for component [450] which will prevent all Rangers from being lawful good! But you can become a grim neutral Ranger instead, or skip over that component and simply pull yourself together to not use those class items you should have no access to ;)
First 2 components will generate warnings about kits to be installed by the following components. I play tested that this does not cause any problems even if you decide to not install all kits.

[100] Base-class Paladin can dual-class to Cleric
	+ Gives only the base class Paladin an ability starting at level 2 to dual-class to Cleric by the normal interface
	  (For once he is special, but for how long?)

[150] All standard Paladin kits can dual-class to Cleric
	+ Gives also the standard Paladin kits the ability starting at level 2 to dual-class to Cleric by the normal interface
	  (I know you want it!)

[200] EE Blackguard can dual-class to Cleric
	+ Gives the Blackguard from the EE the ability starting at level 2 to dual-class to Cleric by the normal interface
	  (First I found it unfitting. But the extra dialog was fun, try the helmet of opposite alignment if you want)

[250] Enable NPC Paladin to acquire 17 Wisdom for dual-classing: Keldorn
	+ Help Keldorn on his personal quest and he may return just that much wiser to become a Cleric
	  (Have I mentioned that Inquisitor/Cleric can cast lvl 7 Spells and turn undead? RIP Sir Anomen... you will not be missed)

Content wise we are basically done at this point. All following components are fixing the quirks arising from the implementation of the Paladin/Cleric as a kitted Ranger/Cleric...

[300] Enable Paladin/Cleric to use all Paladin items
	+ Once your Paladin class gets reactivated after dual-classing you can equip every Paladin item and weapon
	  (On core rules this may be considered a cheat, as Clerics are banned to use swords. But who am I to judge?)

[350] Limit Paladin/Cleric to only use Paladin weapons not restricted by the Cleric multiclass proficencies
	+ Detects your modded or not rule set and bans Paladin weapons illegal for Ranger/Clerics - oh poor Carsomyr!
	  (For those killjoys like me who want to see the gains balanced by some trade off)

[400] Restrict Ranger/Cleric to use Paladin items by enforcing lawful good alignment on good Paladin items
	+ Paladin items are restricted mainly by class, but now they also require you to be pure of heart!
	  (If you think about it, it was rather strange that something so holy like Carsomyr could be wielded by someone evil)

[450] Prevent Paladin/Cleric and Ranger/Cleric to use opposite class items by banning lawful alignment for all Rangers and their items
	+ No Ranger can select lawful good alignment anymore! Prevents any wrong item use by Rangers or Paladin/Clerics
	  (Controversial component! You may be sad, that you can't roleplay as the Aragorn role model anymore. But I grew out of this age)

[500] Allow true neutral alignment for all Rangers to compensate loss of lawful good alignment
	+ Just 2 allowed alignments is simply not enough, now Rangers can be true neutral
	  (I like the trope of the grim Beastmaster or Stalker which never struck me as the lawful types. Let Paladins be the goody-two-shoes)

[550] Prevent Paladin/Cleric to get recognized as a Ranger after Paladin class reactivation
	+ Paladin/Clerics will not get addressed as Rangers in the game world, especially not be offered a certain cabin at Umar Hills.
	  (Very much recommended, detects which dual classing kits you have installed and which not)

If there ever will be a version 3, this component may be included. It is standard dual-class behavior that upon reactivation of the first class the game world world sees you as both: a member of the first and second class. For me this is very much against the narrative of "you stop your first carrier entirely and dedicate your life to the second class". Sure you can keep all the knowledge, but would you address every one as a student even when their years are clearly long past?

[600] Allow Paladin/Cleric to get recognized as a Paladin after dual-class reactivation
	+ Upon reactivating the first class after dual-classing the character would be recognized as a Cleric and Paladin
	  (But it is technically unnecessary complicated and I can live well without it)
